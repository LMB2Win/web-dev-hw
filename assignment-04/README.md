13. I went to ign.com from March 1, 2000. It looks very old school and they have some sections that don't exist anymore like "IGN for Men." There are very few images but it does seem less cluttered than it does now.

14. The GIT Module is a little confusing at first but I am starting to figure it out. I've always found the website to be a bit confusing as someone who just downloads releases but doesn't program.
