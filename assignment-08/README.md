13. I had learned the very basics of HTML in a programming class but we only learned it for about a week so I knew the first couple assignments but nothing past that. The most interesting but also the most difficult for me was the media and styling we learned about in assignment 7.

14. I'm excited to learn CSS because I feel like every site I've made is from the 90s. I'm excited to shoot into the future!

15. I went back to reference past assignments for this project. I went with a table without borders because I liked how structured and concise it looked as an intro to the webpage. I included links to the Nexus to help with setup. I had to play around with the image sizes so they wouldn't take up too much room but also wouldn't stretch. I used the div container to break up the sections.
