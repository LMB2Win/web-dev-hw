13. Most of what I learned was new. I've used GitHub before and learned the very basics of HTML but I feel like I have learned enough to actually start designing a more complex website!

14. Pretty much everything I learned on the programing side was new. I've worked as a graphic designer before so a lot of that wasn't new but I felt it was very important to the course.

15. I took most of assignment 12 and expanded on it. I felt like I was able to use a little more creativity for this one and looked up some elements to add such as text shadow and some filters. I saw the background image awhile ago and really liked it so I got the idea to do some weird sci-fi site for a "Star Breaker" business.
